# CodeWars
This repository is meant to be a library of kata solutions, I am going to scrapp my own CodeWars account and download all the katas that I have solved, the description and the solution I gave it. Mostly I have solved katas in Python, but there are some solved with SQL, Golang or even there are two katas solved in Fortran. 

If there are any doubts on the solutions you can contact me and I will be more than happy to try and solve them.
